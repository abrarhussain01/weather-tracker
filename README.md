# weather-tracker
A simple Python-based application that fetches and displays real-time weather data. It provides details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city.
A Python desktop application built with PyQt5 that provides real-time weather updates using the OpenWeatherMap API.

This project allows users to simply enter the name of a city and instantly receive detailed weather information in a clean and user-friendly interface. It not only shows the current temperature in Celsius, but also provides a text description of the weather condition and a matching emoji representation (☀️, 🌧️, ❄️, 🌪️, etc.), making the report both informative and visually engaging.

The app is designed with a modern GUI layout using PyQt5 widgets and styled with custom fonts and formatting for a polished look. It also includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs, missing API keys, server errors, or connectivity issues, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This project demonstrates the integration of:

* GUI development (PyQt5) for building interactive desktop applications

* REST API consumption (OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live weather data

* Error handling in Python for reliable performance

* Data parsing and presentation with clear visuals and intuitive design

Overall, this weather application serves as a practical example of combining API-driven data retrieval with a desktop-based GUI in Python, making it both educational for learners and useful as a simple daily tool.
